Submission

Fork the repository and push your changes.
Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)
Important Notes
You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
For pairs:
Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
Share tasks evenly and fairly.
To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Wikipedia
Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as one’s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.

Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
